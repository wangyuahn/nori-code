# Contributing to nori-code

Nori Code is a fork of [Kimi Code CLI](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code) (MIT). Contributions are welcome — open an issue first to discuss before submitting a PR.
- Refactors or other changes larger than ~100 lines
- Public API or compatibility changes
- Bug fixes where the cause or fix approach is still unclear

**Can open a PR directly** — link an existing issue when there is one:

- Clear, reproducible bug fixes with a focused diff
- Typos, documentation-only changes, and small CI/build fixes
- Small changes that clearly match an existing issue or maintainer request

## Project Layout

This is a pnpm monorepo. The most relevant entry points are:

- `apps/nori-code` — CLI / TUI
- `apps/vis` — session replay & debugging visualizer
- `packages/node-sdk` — public TypeScript SDK (`@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk`)
- `packages/agent-core`, `kosong`, `kaos`, `oauth`, `telemetry` — internal engine packages
- `docs/` — VitePress bilingual docs site

For the full project map, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Development Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js >= 24.15.0, pnpm 10.33.0, Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wangyuahn/nori-code.git
cd nori-code
pnpm install
```

Useful scripts:

- `pnpm dev:cli` — run the CLI in dev mode
- `pnpm test` — run tests (vitest)
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript check (note: builds packages first)
- `pnpm lint` — oxlint
- `pnpm lint:fix` — oxlint with auto-fix
- `pnpm build` — build all packages

## Commit Convention

All commits and PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

| chore    | Tooling / housekeeping                      | chore: bump dependencies                  |
| refactor | Internal refactor without behavior change   | refactor(kosong): extract retry helper    |
| test     | Adding or improving tests                   | test(agent-core): cover skill resolver    |
| ci       | CI / build pipeline changes                 | ci: cache pnpm store                      |
| build    | Build system / artifact changes             | build(native): add win32-arm64 target     |
| perf     | Performance improvement                     | perf(session): batch event flushes        |
| style    | Formatting only (no logic)                  | style: apply oxlint --fix                 |

PR titles are enforced by the `pr-title-checker` workflow — a non-conforming title will block merge.

## Changesets

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and releases.

- Every PR that affects release artifacts (code, behavior, public API) **must** include a changeset.
- Docs-only, test-only, or CI-only PRs may skip changesets.
- Generate one with `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompts (which packages are touched, which bump level).
- For repo-specific conventions on package selection and bump levels, see `.changeset/README.md`. When working in this repo with coding agents, use the `gen-changesets` skill.

## Pull Requests

Use the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) when opening a feature pull request.

PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](#commit-convention); CI runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` on every PR. Update user-facing docs in `docs/` when behavior changes — use the `gen-docs` skill when working with coding agents.

## Code Style

- TypeScript across the codebase.
- Linting via `oxlint` (config in `.oxlintrc.json`).
- Auto-formatting via `pnpm lint:fix`.
- Follow existing local patterns when the lint rules do not cover a style choice.
